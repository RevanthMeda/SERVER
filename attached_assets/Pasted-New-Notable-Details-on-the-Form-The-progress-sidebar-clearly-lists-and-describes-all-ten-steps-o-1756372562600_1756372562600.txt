New/Notable Details on the Form:

The progress sidebar clearly lists and describes all ten steps of the SAT report process.

Step 1 — Basic Information gathers essential details, including:

Document Title (*required)

Project Reference (*required)

Document Reference

Date (Month/Day/Year format) (*required, still split into three fields, with a “Show date picker” link)

Client Name

Revision and Revision Details

Revision Date (Month/Day/Year format, “Show date picker”)

Contact Information section with a required email field (*Your Email).

Buttons available: Save Progress and Next

User profile info is present (e.g., engineer name and icon).

Issues Still Present:

Date Field Frustration: Still uses three separate number fields (Month/Day/Year); modern forms typically use a unified date picker for better user experience.

Validation Indicators: Required fields marked with an asterisk in text and “required” in the HTML, but no visible inline error feedback or red asterisks.

Accessibility Concerns: Some icons (like , , ) may display as missing for some users; use standard icons or labels for accessibility.

Layout and Clarity: Some fields are not grouped visually, and there’s no contextual help or placeholder text to guide the user.

Progress Navigation: Progress steps are visible but not navigable (only informative).

Suggestions for Current State:

Date Inputs: Replace three-number split fields with a native date picker or a single date input.

Required Field Feedback: Use inline error messages for missing required fields when trying to submit, and highlight required fields more clearly (consider a red asterisk or border on blanks).

Help/Tooltips: Add help icons or hover tooltips on less obvious fields (like “Document Reference”, “Revision Details”).

Accessibility: Replace non-rendering or obscure icons with accessible SVGs or font icons; add screen reader labels where appropriate.

Visual Clarity: Visually group related fields under appropriate headings.
