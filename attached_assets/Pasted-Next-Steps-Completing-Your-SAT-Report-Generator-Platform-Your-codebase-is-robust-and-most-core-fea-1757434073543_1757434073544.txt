Next Steps: Completing Your SAT Report Generator Platform
Your codebase is robust and most core features are in place. To unblock your approval workflow and polish the platform for production, focus on these four priority areas:

1. Email Notification Integration
Verify SMTP Configuration
– Confirm your .env settings (SMTP_SERVER, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USERNAME, SMTP_PASSWORD) by sending a test email at startup.

Build an Email‐Sender Utility
– Create a reusable function (e.g., send_email(recipient, subject, html_body)) using Python’s smtplib or Flask-Mail.

Trigger Emails on Status Change
– After each transition (DRAFT→SUBMITTED, TM_APPROVED, PM_APPROVED), enqueue a Celery task that:

Reads Notification.create_notification

Calls send_email with a customized approval link and context data

Dashboard Alerts
– Update notifications_bp to show unread notifications in the UI and mark them read when clicked.

2. Approval Workflow State Management
Centralize State Transitions
– Define an enum or constants for each state (DRAFT, SUBMITTED, TM_APPROVED, PM_APPROVED, DELIVERED, REJECTED).

Encapsulate Transitions in a Service Layer
– Create a ReportWorkflow class with methods submit(), approve_tm(), approve_pm(), deliver(), reject(reason) that:

Update report.status

Append an entry to approvals_json (timestamp, user, action)

Save and return the new state

Enforce Role‐Based Guards
– In each route:

Ensure only the appropriate role can call the transition (e.g., TM can only call approve_tm())

Return a 403 for unauthorized attempts

Validate Full Flow End‐to‐End
– Write unit tests for every transition, including rejection loops back to DRAFT or SUBMITTED.

3. Cleanup LSP Diagnostics & Code Quality
Imports & Unused Variables
– Run flake8 and address all warnings in routes/main.py, app.py, and models.py.

Template Syntax
– Use Jinja linting (e.g., jinjalint) to catch missing closing tags in SAT.html.

Refactor Document Engine
– Move brute_force_replace_in_runs into a dedicated doc_engine.py module and add docstrings.

Enforce Formatting & Safety
– Add black and isort to your CI pipeline, plus a pre-commit hook.

4. Production‐Ready Security & Deployment
Enable HTTPS
– Configure ssl_context=(CERT_PATH, KEY_PATH) in app.run using your .pfx certificate.

Harden Session Security
– Set SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True, REMEMBER_COOKIE_HTTPONLY=True, and use short lifetimes for sensitive roles.

Limit Upload Sizes
– Add app.config['MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH'] = 16 * 1024 * 1024 to prevent large file abuse.

Monitor & Logging
– Integrate Sentry or Loggly for real‐time error alerts in production.

Backup & Cleanup
– Schedule a daily cron job to archive old outputs and purge temporary files.
