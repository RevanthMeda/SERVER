Based on the current content of the SAT Report Generator page, here are some potential issues and suggested improvements:

Issues Identified
Form Field UX:

The order and grouping of some fields may not be intuitive for users.

Some fields such as Date and Revision Date use three separate inputs (Month/Day/Year), which can frustrate users. A unified date picker improves UX.

Repeated “Show date picker” text appears after date fields, which may be redundant if a date picker widget is already available.

Validation and Clarity:

Required fields are marked with asterisks, but there is no visible red asterisk or error messaging shown for missing fields.

No placeholder text or formatting guide for inputs like dates or email field, which can help reduce input errors.

No explicit validation feedback when entering invalid or incomplete information.

Accessibility:

The required fields rely on an asterisk (*) but this may not be clear for screen readers or visually impaired users.

"aria-label" attributes help, but actual form validation or error highlighting could help more.

General UI/UX:

The action/button area may be cluttered ("Save Progress" and "Next" might be too close together). Clear separation or logical grouping may increase usability.

The header uses icons and emojis (like  and ) which may not render well for all users or environments.

There is little help or tooltip information for unclear fields.

Recommended Changes
Improve Date Input:

Replace separate Month/Day/Year fields with a single calendar date picker for all date fields.

Remove or make conditional the “Show date picker” text.

Validation & Error Messaging:

Clearly indicate required fields with a red asterisk and show dynamic error messages if required fields are left blank.

Add inline validation and helper text for formats (e.g., “Enter a valid email address”).

Accessibility:

Use ARIA roles and landmarks for better screen reader navigation.

Display clear, accessible error messages (not just visual cues like color).

Form UX Improvements:

Group related fields with visual sections or headings.

Add placeholder text where missing.

Add help icons or tooltips for unclear fields (e.g., what qualifies as “Document Reference”?).

UI Cleanliness:

Use scalable vector icons or standard web fonts for symbols to avoid rendering issues.

Make sure all action buttons are clearly labeled and appropriately spaced.
