## Introduction
The UserAnalytics model serves as the central data structure for tracking performance metrics and KPIs across the organization. It captures daily productivity, process efficiency, and timeliness metrics for users involved in report creation and approval workflows. This documentation provides comprehensive details about the model's structure, data aggregation mechanisms, query patterns, and usage scenarios for both administrative and operational purposes.

## Data Model Structure
The UserAnalytics model is implemented as a database table that stores daily performance summaries for each user. The model captures key productivity indicators and process efficiency metrics, enabling time-series analysis and performance benchmarking across the organization.

```mermaid
erDiagram
USER_ANALYTICS {
int id PK
string user_email
date date
int reports_created
int reports_approved
int reports_rejected
float avg_completion_time
float approval_cycle_time
float on_time_percentage
text custom_metrics
}
```

## Field Definitions
The UserAnalytics model contains the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| user_email | String(120) | Unique identifier for the user, used for cross-referencing with the users table |
| date | Date | Date of the performance metrics, enabling time-series analysis |
| reports_created | Integer | Count of reports created by the user on the specified date |
| reports_approved | Integer | Count of reports approved by the user on the specified date |
| reports_rejected | Integer | Count of reports rejected by the user on the specified date |
| avg_completion_time | Float | Average time in hours taken to complete reports on the specified date |
| approval_cycle_time | Float | Average time in hours for reports to complete the approval cycle on the specified date |
| on_time_percentage | Float | Percentage of reports completed on time, with 100.0 as the default value |
| custom_metrics | Text | JSON field storing additional custom metrics for extensibility |

## Daily Aggregation Process
The system automatically aggregates data daily from completed workflows and updates the UserAnalytics metrics. This process occurs at the end of each day, summarizing all completed report workflows and calculating the relevant KPIs for each user.

```mermaid

Start([Daily Aggregation Process]) --> CollectData["Collect Completed Workflows"]
CollectData --> GroupByUser["Group Data by User"]
GroupByUser --> CalculateMetrics["Calculate KPIs<br>• Count reports<br>• Average times<br>• Approval rates"]
CalculateMetrics --> StoreResults["Store Results in UserAnalytics"]
StoreResults --> UpdateCustom["Update custom_metrics JSON"]
UpdateCustom --> End([Daily Metrics Updated])
```

## Analytics Query Examples
The UserAnalytics model supports various aggregation queries for performance analysis. These queries enable administrators to extract meaningful insights from the collected metrics.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
Query1["Get Top Performers<br>SELECT user_email, SUM(reports_created)<br>FROM user_analytics<br>WHERE date >= :start_date<br>GROUP BY user_email<br>ORDER BY reports_created DESC<br>LIMIT 10"] --> Result1["Top 10 users by reports created"]
Query2["Calculate Team Efficiency<br>SELECT AVG(avg_completion_time),<br>AVG(approval_cycle_time)<br>FROM user_analytics<br>WHERE user_email IN :team_members<br>AND date >= :start_date"] --> Result2["Average completion and approval times"]
Query3["Analyze Trend Over Time<br>SELECT date, AVG(on_time_percentage)<br>FROM user_analytics<br>WHERE date >= :start_date<br>GROUP BY date<br>ORDER BY date"] --> Result3["Daily on-time percentage trend"]
Query4["Identify Productivity Patterns<br>SELECT user_email, reports_created,<br>reports_approved, reports_rejected<br>FROM user_analytics<br>WHERE date = :specific_date"] --> Result4["Daily productivity snapshot"]
```

## Time-Series Reporting
The UserAnalytics model enables comprehensive time-series reporting by storing daily metrics that can be aggregated over various time periods. This allows for trend analysis and performance tracking over time.

```mermaid

Daily["Daily Records"] --> Weekly["Weekly Aggregation"]
Daily --> Monthly["Monthly Aggregation"]
Daily --> Quarterly["Quarterly Aggregation"]
Weekly --> W_Report["Weekly Performance Reports"]
Monthly --> M_Report["Monthly Performance Reports"]
Quarterly --> Q_Report["Quarterly Performance Reports"]
W_Report --> Dashboards["Executive Dashboards"]
M_Report --> Dashboards
Q_Report --> Dashboards
Dashboards --> Decisions["Business Decisions"]
```

## Dashboard Visualizations
The system provides various dashboard visualizations that consume UserAnalytics data to present performance metrics in an accessible format for different stakeholders.

## API Access for Team Leads
Team leads access summary analytics through dedicated API endpoints that provide aggregated performance data for their teams, enabling them to monitor team productivity and identify areas for improvement.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant TL as "Team Lead"
participant API as "Analytics API"
participant DB as "Database"
participant UA as "UserAnalytics Model"
TL->>API : GET /api/user-performance?days=30
API->>DB : Query UserAnalytics data
DB->>UA : Retrieve records for team members
UA-->>DB : Return filtered results
DB-->>API : Aggregate and format data
API-->>TL : Return JSON response with team metrics
Note over TL,API : Team lead receives summary analytics<br>for performance monitoring

## Conclusion
The UserAnalytics model provides a robust framework for tracking and analyzing organizational performance metrics. By capturing daily productivity data and process efficiency indicators, it enables data-driven decision-making for performance management, process optimization, and capacity planning. The model's design supports efficient querying through appropriate indexing and allows for extensibility via the custom_metrics JSON field. With automated daily aggregation from completed workflows, the system ensures timely and accurate performance data is available to administrators and team leads through both dashboard visualizations and API access.
